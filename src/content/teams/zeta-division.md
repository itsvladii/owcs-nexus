## About Crazy Raccoons

ZETA DIVISION is one of the most acclaimed esports org in Japan, and they re-entered in OWCS on June 13, 2024 for the Esports World Cup after disbanding in 2020 when it was competing in Overwatch Contenders. They bought the "From The Gamer" roster that ended in 3rd place during OWCS Asia Stage 1 and they placed in 3rd place after losing to Toronto Ultra, and ever since then they got 2nd place in 2024 Korea Stage 2 and 2025 Korea Stage 1, albeit failing to qualify to a Major LAN event ever since the 2024 Esports World Cup.
