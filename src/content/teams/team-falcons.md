## About Team Falcons

Team Falcons is one of the biggest, most dominant esports organization in the world. Based in Saudi Arabia, they entered in OWCS in April of 2024 by acquiring the org-less "Hamster" team in OWCS Korea. Since then, the Falcons have been a formidable foe to face against, winning multiple championships in OWCS Korea 2024 and most importantly of them all, winning the 2024 OWCS World Finals in Dreamhack Stockholm.

Even more impressive is their run in the 2025 Esports World Cup, where they won the whole thing by starting from the Last Chance Qualifiers and guaranteed Falcons the win they needed in the Club Championship in order to compete for the 70M dollars prize pool. Eventually, the Overwatch division played a crucial role in gifting the Falcons the 2025 Esports World Cup, as it was the only win from the Saudi org in the competition.

This season
has been a constant rollercoaster for Falcons, with big roster shakeups and questionable moments in the server, but one thing is for sure: you cannot count them out.
