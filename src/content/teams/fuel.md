As a famous Australian philosopher said in 2021, “those who burn blue, burn the brightest.”

Dallas Fuel is one of the most historic franchises in the Overwatch League era, having had the honor of being the first champion team in the Overwatch 2 era and hosting many legends of the sport, such as ChiYo, Fielder, Hanbin, Fearless, and many others.

And after a two-year hiatus, the Fuel are back. They return for the 2026 season in OWCS as a Partner Team in North America, and one thing is certain: they will want to repeat their success in this new era of Overwatch Esports.
