## About Crazy Raccoons

Crazy Raccoons entered in OWCS in April of 2024 by signing the org-less "WAC" team that was competing in OWCS Korea, and since then the Japanese org has found plenty of
success by forming one of the best rosters Overwatch Esports has ever seen.

Taking home countless other important tournaments during the last year and a half, including wins at the 2024 Major in Dreamhack Dallas and in the Esports World Cup in the same year, they just felt short of doing the three-peat by losing to their bitter rivals in Team Falcons in the 2024 OWCS World Finals in Dreamhack Stockholm. Nonetherless, they're still hungry for trophies and accolades and are still a very tough customer for everyone else in the server.
