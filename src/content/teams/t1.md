## About Crazy Raccoons

T1 is one of the most recognizable orgs in the whole esports worlds, mainly for their legendary League of Legends roster. The Korean org entered in OWCS as a Partner Team during the start of the 2025 season by signing the core of the org-less "HaejeokDan" team in OWCS Korea, completed with Proud and Donghak.

As the biggest esports organization in South Korea, T1 were expected to challenge the top dogs of the region, and while they didn't manage to win any domestic titles outside of a SOOP Cup held in Korea before the Champions Clash, they've shown immense growth in a very competitive region where Crazy Raccoons and Team Falcons were the undisputed top-dogs. After a bittersweet 4th place in the 2025 Esports World Cup, T1 are more motivated than ever to snatch their first international trophy in Overwatch.
