It has been a decade long wait, but the Korean dominance in Overwatch Esports has been finally broken (for now), as Twisted Minds are your 2025 OWCS World Champions after a nail-bitting EMEA affair in the Grand Final against their historical rivals in Al Qadsiah.

After an intense 2025 season where the gap between Korea and the rest of the world seemed to be closing at every Major LAN event, the long awaited triumph for Western Overwatch has finally arrived with EMEA taking the crown as the region to beat going ahead in the 2026 season of OWCS.

### One time is a fluke, two times is a coincidence, but three times...
Going into the 2025 World Finals, everyone expected that Korea would once again go and win everything, but there was a sliver of hope that someone outside of Korea could interrupt the decade-old dominance of Korea in Overwatch. 

Over the course of the 2025 season, something started to change: NA and EMEA teams were starting to look more competitive than ever against the Korean juggernauts in Crazy Raccoons and Team Falcons. During the first Major of the year in Hangzhou, alarm bells started to sound as NTMR shocked the world and defeated Crazy Raccoon in a historical 3-1 victory that signaled the very first time a non-Korean team took down a Korean team in a Major official tournament in OWCS. But at the end of the day, as much as an accomplishment it was for NTMR to end in 3rd place behind CR and TF in the Champions Clash, it didn't really look like the gap was closing. A "fluke" by CR, if you will.

But then, the Midseason Championship arrived in Riyadh. And everything changed. Now teams in EMEA looked incredibly strong against everyone, thanks to a trick up their sleeve that the Koreans still do not have an answer to this day: Symmetra. EMEA teams like Al Qadsiah and Twisted Minds knew that the only way to match the calculated agressiveness of the Korean rosters was to be themselves agressive, but in a much more strategic way by utilizing Symmetra to her full potential with her Teleport, a hero that unless you were TM or AQ no one was really thinking that it was going to be the key to success.

But TM and AQ have mastered the Symmetra strat and added a whole 'nother layer of strategy in the server that the Koreans simply weren't prepared for; the Sym teleport could move the entire team to the opposite part of the map and completely flip the fight over its head. And while in Riyadh the title still went to a Korean roster with a resounding 4-0 win against Al Qadisah, things started to change. A lot.

### Back down to earth for Korea
