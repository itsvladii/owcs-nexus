Proper is a player who needs no introduction: the South Korean Flex DPS is widely regarded as one of the most mechanically gifted and crystaline talents in Overwatch history, with a trophy case already overflowing with trophies and individual awards despite his young age.


Proper's professional carreer started in the Overwatch Contenders where during his stay with the renowned O2 Blast, the official academy of San Francisco Shock in the Overwatch League, he proved to be an extraordinary talent by winning three seasons of Overwatch Contenders Korea between 2019 and 2021.


His performances in Contenders with O2 Blast earned him a debut in the 2021-2022 OWL season with the 2-time OWL Champions San Fransisco Shock where, despite the seemingly insurmountable jump in difficulty between Contenders and OWL, he went on to produce one of the most impressive rookie seasons ever as he became the first (and currently only) player in OW E-sports history to win Regular Season MVP, Rookie of the Year, and Role Star in a single season. It is no coincidence that one of Proper's idols is Faker, the legendary mid-laner from League of Legends.


Despite his impressive individual records however, Proper never managed to win a title with the Shock, and with the Overwatch League closing its doors in 2023, he decided to get back into the mix in his native South Korea.


With the birth of the Overwatch Champions Series, Proper first competed in OWCS Korea in an orgless team called “Hamster” before being signed by the Saudi org Team Falcons, where he immediatly became the backbone of the team. During his first year in OWCS with the Falcons, Proper continued to showcase his innate flexibility and skill in the Flex DPS role and managed to win numerous domestic titles in Korea, but he was missing one last piece to be elevated to GOAT status: an international trophy. 


This "curse" was finally broken at the 2024 OWCS World Finals in Stockholm, where Proper won the coveted international trophy and officially being crowned as one of the best Flex DPS players to ever touch the game. But his hunger did not subside, quite the contrary.


During the 2025 OWCS season, Proper continued to play as only he knows how. Despite being benched by the Falcons staff to integrate Mer1t and Someone into the roster during Stage 2 in Korea, he returned in grand style for the Midseason Championship in Riyadh and was the X factor that allowed the Falcons to win the tournament, even ending up being crowned MVP of the tournament. Now his eyes are set on the 2025 World Finals in Stockholm once again, with a single goal: to win it again and end the debate about who is the best Overwatch player in history.
